# QPC_Investigation

Contents of the `\notebooks` folder are [*Pluto*](https://juliapackages.com/p/pluto) notebooks, these can be run interactively.
To achieve this:
- navigate to the location of the project, and more importantly the `manifest.toml` & `project.toml` files
- run *Julia* with: `julia --project==./`
- bring the *Pluto* package into the scope with: `julia> using Pluto`
- run the *Pluto* server with `julia> Pluto.run()`
