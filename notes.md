# BEng Project Direction

## Implemented :

1. Chalker-Coddingtion Network Model

	Discretised network form of a scattering model.
	Conductance calculated by finding eigenstates of total system's scattering matrix.

2. Plotted Experimential Results

	Conductance traces for a QPC with varying split-gate bias voltage.
	Data split into `clean` and `noisy` samples:
		- `clean` contains traces for QPC without any impurities in the channel
		- `noisy` is traces with impurities in the channel (impurity type unknown **TBC**)

## Where To Next? :

- is a time dependent q-conductance sim possible?
- is a model based on analytical forms (ie. considering Ïˆ's) possible
-
